# TSP-algorithms
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical computer science.

In this repository I gather algorithms for solving travelling salesman problem. All scripts here can get input files with the common format (list of coordinates of nodes, each node on the new line), so all algorithms can be tested on same sets of nodes and compared to each other. I also include a random test cases generator here.
