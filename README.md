# TSP-algorithms
In this repository I gather algorithms for solving travelling salesman problem. All scripts here can get input files with the common format (list of coordinates of nodes, each node on the new line), so all algorithms can be tested on same sets of nodes and compared to each other. I also include a random test cases generator here.
