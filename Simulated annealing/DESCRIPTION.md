**Simulated annealing** (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. [Read on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)

In my first implementation of this algorithm I used a mutation function that ranomly swapped one or more pairs of nodes in a path. This implementation didn't work better than [ACO](https://github.com/astraszab/TSP-algorithms/tree/master/Ant%20colony%20optimization) and tend to stuck in bad local optima. After that I changed a mutation function to choosing two random nodes in a path and reversing everything in between them. With a new mutation algorithm works much better and finds good paths in reasonable time. Thanks to [dmitryklebanov](https://github.com/dmitriyklebanov) for the idea of this improvement.
